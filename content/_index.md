# Hello! I'm A. Michael Tatum.

As a Cloud Linux Engineer in the Austin, Texas area, I architect secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure that delivers measurable business results. With deep expertise in Linux, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and automation, I build resilient, high-availability systems designed to accelerate deployment cycles, maximize uptime, and meet rigorous security and compliance standards. My focus is on engineering tangible outcomes through intelligent cloud-native solutions.
